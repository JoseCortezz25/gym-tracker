## 6. Copywriting Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Brand Voice Attributes

**Direct**: No fluff, no jargon. Say what you mean.
**Motivating**: Inspire action without being preachy.
**Empowering**: "You can do this. Here's how."
**Data-Driven**: Numbers matter. Progress is measurable.
**Anti-BS**: Call out common gym frustrations. Be real.

### Writing Rules

1. **Active Voice Always**: "Track your workouts" > "Workouts can be tracked"
2. **Short Sentences**: Punchy. Scannable. Easy to digest.
3. **Second Person ("You")**: Make it personal and direct.
4. **No Gym Bro Cliches**: Avoid "gains train", "beast mode", "crush it" unless ironic.
5. **Show, Don't Tell**: "See exactly what you lifted last week" > "We have great tracking"
6. **Numbers = Credibility**: "50+ exercises", "23-day streak", "125,450 lbs volume"

### Example Copy Transformations

| Before (Generic) | After (Direct + Motivating) |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| "Our app helps you track your workouts" | "Log every rep. Beat last week. Make progress." |
| "We offer customizable training programs" | "Your program, your schedule. Zero compromises." |
| "Stay motivated with our tracking features" | "Streak counter + visible wins = unstoppable momentum" |
| "Advanced analytics for serious athletes" | "See your total volume climb. Data doesn't lie." |

## 7. Visual Content Recommendations

### Hero Section Visual
**Recommendation**: Animated mockup of app dashboard showing:
- Active workout session with live timer (counting up)
- Previous session data visible for comparison
- Streak counter badge pulsing at "23 days"
- Volume graph animating upward

**Why**: Shows app in action + key differentiators (tracking, streaks, progress) in one visual.

---

### Feature Section Visuals
**Recommendation**: Screenshot + icon for each feature:
1. **Custom Routines**: Screenshot of routine builder interface
2. **Real-Time Tracking**: Screenshot of active workout with timer
3. **Progressive Overload**: Screenshot of exercise history comparison
4. **Streak Tracking**: Screenshot of dashboard with stats highlighted

**Why**: Concrete proof of functionality builds trust faster than illustrations.

---

### How It Works Section Visuals
**Recommendation**: 3-step visual flow with numbered screenshots:
1. Routine builder (empty → filled)
2. Active workout screen (logging sets)
3. Dashboard (stats populating)

**Why**: Shows user journey from setup to success in digestible steps.

---

### Exercise Library Visual
**Recommendation**: Grid of exercise cards (6-8 visible, infinite scroll implied)
- Each card shows: Exercise name, category, thumbnail/icon
- Final card: "Create Custom Exercise" with + icon

**Why**: Demonstrates depth of library + customization in one glance.

---

### Social Proof Visual
**Recommendation**: Testimonial cards with:
- User avatar or placeholder
- Star rating (5/5)
- Quote in large text
- Name + lifter type (e.g., "Intermediate Lifter")

**Why**: Faces + names + specifics = authenticity.

---

## 8. Conversion Optimization Tactics

### Above-the-Fold Priority
- **Headline + Subheadline**: Immediately communicate value
- **Primary CTA**: Visible without scrolling
- **Hero Visual**: Show app in action (not generic stock photo)
- **Trust Signal**: "Free to start. No credit card required." (subtext)

### Reduce Friction
- **No Login Wall**: Let users explore features before signup
- **Simple Signup**: Email + password (no 10-field form)
- **Guest Mode Option**: "Try a demo workout" without account
- **Mobile-First Design**: 70%+ of gym users browse on mobile

### Social Proof Placement
- **Testimonials**: After feature section, before final CTA
- **User Count**: "Join 10,000+ lifters" (if applicable) in hero or final CTA
- **Trust Badges**: "Privacy First" or "Secure Data" in footer

### Urgency (Optional, Use Sparingly)
- **Launch Promo**: "Early access: All features free during beta"
- **Scarcity**: "Limited spots for beta testers" (only if true)

**Warning**: Avoid false urgency. It destroys trust with serious lifters.

---

## 9. Mobile-Specific Considerations

### Mobile Hero Section
- **Headline**: Shorter version ("Stop Guessing. Start Progressing." works)
- **CTA**: Larger touch target (min 48px height)
- **Visual**: Vertical phone mockup instead of desktop view

### Mobile Feature Section
- **Layout**: Stack features vertically (1 per screen section)
- **Icons**: Larger, more prominent on mobile
- **Copy**: Shorter paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

### Mobile CTA Strategy
- **Sticky CTA**: Fixed "Get Started" button at bottom of screen
- **Scroll Trigger**: Show sticky CTA after user scrolls past hero
- **Thumb Zone**: Position CTAs in easy-to-reach areas (bottom 1/3 of screen)

---

## 10. A/B Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Headline Variation
- **Version A**: "Stop Guessing. Start Progressing." (recommended)
- **Version B**: "Every Rep Counts. Every Set Matters." (data-driven)
- **Hypothesis**: Direct pain point language ("stop guessing") converts better than aspirational language ("every rep counts")

### Test 2: CTA Text
- **Version A**: "Start Training Smarter" (benefit-focused)
- **Version B**: "Get Started Free" (friction-reducing)
- **Hypothesis**: Emphasizing "free" removes objection, increases signups

### Test 3: Social Proof Position
- **Version A**: Testimonials after feature section
- **Version B**: Testimonials immediately after problem section
- **Hypothesis**: Earlier social proof validates pain points faster, increases trust

### Test 4: Hero Visual
- **Version A**: Animated app mockup (recommended)
- **Version B**: Real photo of person using app at gym
- **Hypothesis**: Real human using app increases relatability and conversion
